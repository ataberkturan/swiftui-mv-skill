SwiftUI MV Skill is an agent skill for building, refactoring, and reviewing
SwiftUI apps with a clean `MV + Services + DataStore + DesignSystem`
architecture.

It helps Agents make consistent architecture decisions while working inside
SwiftUI projects. Instead of creating ViewModels by default, it keeps UI, state,
business logic, reusable components, resources, and utilities in clear ownership
boundaries.

## Who This Is For

- Developers who want SwiftUI features organized without defaulting to MVVM.
- Teams standardizing app folders around Views, Models, Enums, Services,
  DataStore, DesignSystem, Resources, and Utils.
- Agent workflows that need repeatable guidance for Swift Observation,
  service injection, reusable UI boundaries, and architecture reviews.
- SwiftUI projects that need a lightweight audit before refactors or code
  review.

## How To Use This Skill

### Option A: Using skills.sh

Install this skill with the open `skills` CLI:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill --skill swiftui-mv
```

For Codex:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill --skill swiftui-mv -a codex -g
```

For Claude Code:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill --skill swiftui-mv -a claude-code -g
```

Then ask your agent to use the skill, for example:

> Use the SwiftUI MV skill and review this app's architecture boundaries.

### Option B: Claude Code Plugin

This repository includes a Claude Code marketplace at
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and a plugin manifest at
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Add the marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace add ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill
```

Install the plugin:

```text
/plugin install swiftui-mv@swiftui-mv-skill
```

After installation, the skill is available as a namespaced plugin skill:

```text
/swiftui-mv:swiftui-mv
```

### Option C: Codex Plugin

This repository includes a Codex plugin manifest at
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Install it with the Codex Marketplace CLI:

```bash
npx codex-marketplace add ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill --plugin --global
```

For a project-local install:

```bash
npx codex-marketplace add ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill --plugin --project
```

### Option D: Codex / OpenAI-Compatible Tools

This repository includes an `agents/openai.yaml` manifest. Copy or symlink the
`swiftui-mv/` folder into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
cp -R swiftui-mv/ "$CODEX_HOME/skills/swiftui-mv"
```

You can also install from inside Codex with Skill Installer:

```text
$skill-installer install https://github.com/ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill/tree/main/swiftui-mv
```

### Option E: Manual Install

Clone this repository and copy the same `swiftui-mv/` skill folder into your
agent's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ataberkturan/swiftui-mv-skill.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills ~/.claude/skills
cp -R swiftui-mv-skill/swiftui-mv ~/.codex/skills/
cp -R swiftui-mv-skill/swiftui-mv ~/.claude/skills/
```

Restart your agent if the skill does not appear immediately.

## What's Inside

SwiftUI MV Skill guides an AI coding agent to:

- inspect the existing SwiftUI project structure before making changes
- keep screen-local state inside SwiftUI views
- move business logic, networking, persistence, auth, subscriptions, and domain
  actions into services
- keep global app state in an Observation-based DataStore
- organize reusable UI code inside a DesignSystem
- separate raw app assets and files into Resources
- place general-purpose helpers and extensions inside Utils
- avoid creating ViewModels unless the project already uses them or the user
  explicitly asks for that architecture
- run a read-only architecture audit with the bundled helper script

This skill is opinionated about ownership boundaries, not about visual style.
It does not try to replace native SwiftUI design guidance, animation guidance,
or app-specific product decisions.

## Architecture Model

The skill prefers this root-level SwiftUI app structure when the app needs those
areas:

```text
Project
├── Views
├── Models
├── Enums
├── Services
├── DataStore
├── DesignSystem
├── Resources
└── Utils
```

Folder responsibilities:

- `Views`: SwiftUI screens, screen-local state, local view fragments, and
  screen-specific extensions.
- `Models`: data models, domain models, API models, persistence models, and
  DTO-like types.
- `Enums`: shared app, route, mode, category, domain, and service-level enum
  types.
- `Services`: business logic and external systems such as networking,
  authentication, storage, subscriptions, remote config, notifications,
  payments, and backend communication.
- `DataStore`: app-wide observable state and global source of truth, preferably
  using Swift Observation with `@Observable`.
- `DesignSystem`: reusable UI components, button styles, visual modifiers,
  colors, typography, icons, spacing, and native SwiftUI style extensions.
- `Resources`: raw non-Swift files such as asset catalogs, images, icons, JSON,
  audio, video, fonts, markdown, PDFs, and SVGs.
- `Utils`: general helper code, Swift extensions, technical view modifiers,
  validators, date helpers, and other non-design-system utilities.

Unused folders do not need to be created just to satisfy the structure.

## Architecture Audit

The bundled audit helper performs a read-only structural check for common
SwiftUI MV boundary violations:

```bash
python3 swiftui-mv/scripts/audit_swiftui_mv.py /path/to/SwiftUI/project
```

Use JSON output for automation:

```bash
python3 swiftui-mv/scripts/audit_swiftui_mv.py /path/to/SwiftUI/project --json
```

Use strict mode when warnings should fail the audit:

```bash
python3 swiftui-mv/scripts/audit_swiftui_mv.py /path/to/SwiftUI/project --strict
```

The audit is intentionally conservative. Treat its findings as prompts for code
inspection, not as a complete Swift semantic analysis.

## Skill Structure

```text
swiftui-mv/
  SKILL.md
  references/
    core-architecture.md - Root folders, high-level boundaries, routing, and the no-default-ViewModel rule
    services.md - Service responsibilities, business logic boundaries, injection, and Observation requirements
    datastore.md - Global app state, app-level source of truth, persistence coordination, and store/service boundaries
    observation-environment.md - @Observable, SwiftUI Environment injection, @Bindable, and ObservableObject migration
    view-organization.md - Screen folders, local components, view extensions, and screen-specific state
    design-system.md - Reusable UI components, native SwiftUI styles, tokens, and visual modifiers
    resources.md - Raw non-Swift app files and the Resources vs DesignSystem boundary
    utils.md - General helpers, extensions, validators, and the Utils vs DesignSystem boundary
    examples.md - Canonical folder trees and correct/wrong architecture examples
  scripts/
    audit_swiftui_mv.py - Read-only structural audit for SwiftUI MV boundary violations
```

`swiftui-mv/` is the canonical skill folder. It contains the required
`SKILL.md`, optional UI metadata, references, and the read-only audit helper.

## Publishing

This repository is prepared for multiple distribution paths:

- `skills.sh`: install with `npx skills add ... --skill swiftui-mv`.
- Claude Code plugin marketplace: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` points to
  this repository as a plugin source.
- Codex plugin marketplace: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` describes the plugin
  bundle for `npx codex-marketplace`.
- Codex/OpenAI-compatible tools: `agents/openai.yaml` lists the skill metadata.
- `pi`: `package.json` declares the skill folder under `pi.skills`.

Before publishing a release, validate local discovery:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool .claude-plugin/plugin.json
python3 -m json.tool .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
python3 -m json.tool .codex-plugin/plugin.json
npx skills add . --skill swiftui-mv --list
python3 -m unittest tests.test_audit_swiftui_mv
```

## Contributing

Contributions should keep `SKILL.md` concise and move detailed guidance into
topic-specific files under `swiftui-mv/references/`. The skill should remain
focused on SwiftUI MV architecture boundaries rather than generic SwiftUI
styling, animation, or platform API coverage.
